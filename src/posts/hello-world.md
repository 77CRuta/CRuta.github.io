# Hello World

Welcome to my blog. This is the first post.

Write your posts in plain Markdown — headings, bold, lists, links, code blocks, all supported out of the box.

## Adding a new post

Create a new `.md` file in the `src/posts/` folder with the same front matter:

```markdown
---
title: My Next Post
date: 2026-03-01
tags: post
layout: base.njk
---
```

The home page will pick it up automatically.
